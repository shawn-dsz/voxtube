# Clarifications Log - 001-tauri-desktop

## Q1: Cache directory location
**Decision**: Use OS standard paths (`~/Library/Application Support/VoxTube/cache/`)
**Reasoning**: macOS apps can't write to their own bundle. Standard paths ensure persistence for installed apps.
**Impact**: FR-004 updated

## Q2: External dependency bundling
**Decision**: Bundle everything (bun build --compile + yt CLI sidecar)
**Reasoning**: True double-click experience without requiring dev tools in PATH.
**Impact**: FR-006 added, edge case about missing bun resolved

## Q3: Port conflict handling
**Decision**: Fail gracefully with error message in window
**Reasoning**: Safest approach, no backend code changes needed.
**Impact**: FR-008 added

## Q4: Server logging
**Decision**: Log files in ~/Library/Application Support/VoxTube/logs/
**Reasoning**: Essential for diagnosing server crashes in a desktop environment.
**Impact**: FR-007 added
